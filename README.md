# 🥗 Machine Learning Based Diet Recommendation Model

This project is an AI-powered *diet recommendation system* that helps individuals plan personalized diets based on various health metrics and goals. It uses *machine learning algorithms* to recommend daily nutrition intake suitable for human health.

## 💡 Objective
To design and implement a model that suggests customized diet plans for users by analyzing their health parameters like:
- Age
- Gender
- Weight
- Height
- Activity level
- Dietary goals (weight loss, maintenance, gain)
- Existing medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cholesterol)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 ML Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree / Random Forest (for classification of diet type)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (for similar health profile clustering)
- Linear Regression (for calorie prediction)

## 🧪 Dataset
- Custom dataset created from online sources + standard nutrition tables
- Cleaned and preprocessed using Python

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diet-recommendation-model.git
   cd diet-recommendation-model
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   jupyter notebook
